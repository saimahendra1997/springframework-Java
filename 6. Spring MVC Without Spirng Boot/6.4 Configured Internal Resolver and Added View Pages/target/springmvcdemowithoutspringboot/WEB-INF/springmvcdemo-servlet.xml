	Here we have to do the configuration we don't have to actually manually mention each controller.
	the Reason being we are using annotations in the class by saying @Controller and doing the mapping 
	by specifying @RequestMapping. But what if we don't want to do mapping in the controller or in the class?
	In that case, in this particular file we have to do all the mapping by specifying for this request call this particular method
	like that.As we are already using annotations so we just have to mention to our DispatcherServlet by saying, 
	we're already using annotations on the controllers.Just use them directly
	
	The way we can mention by saying firstly hey DispatcherServlet find the classes in this package and secondly we have to mention
	we are already suing annotations. We have to define those tags which are defined in bean definition(bean-tags)
	After mentioning the bean tags we can talk to DispatcherServlet.The first thing we can mention is component-scan(<ctx:component-scan base-package="springmvcdemo" />)
	and secondly we have to specify that we are using annotations for that we have to use <ctx:annotation-config/>
	
	After we run this we will be getting an error saying that - No endpoint GET /springmvcdemowithoutspringboot/index.

	At this point, the configuration will successfully call the controller, but there may be errors regarding view rendering. 
	To resolve view-related errors, we need configure the Internal Resource View Resolver to correctly map views (e.g., JSP files).
	
	Remember when we were worked with the spring boot application, We are returning index there, but in the property files we have mentioned
	that we have to find the index in this particular folder and we have to find and the extension for that index is .jsp.
	Here Nowhere we are doing that. So that means we have to also configure the resolver.Earlier we have discussed that when we return 
	this behind the scene it uses something called a resolver which is called internal resource view resolver.
	
	
	To Configure the view resolver we have to mention the qualified path, which is the full path for the class.
	To find that navigate to Maven Dependency -> org.springframework.web.servlet -> org.springframework.web.servlet.view -> expand the package
	we can see the class InternalResourceViewResolver.class copy the qualified name
	
	Add the bean tag and mention class name = paste the qualified name without .class extension we have to set 2 properties which is prefix and suffix
	
	
	when we run this we are not getting the value we wanted, the value which is alien data and we wanted it to print. 
	Welcome to the world is not working. If we go to the home controller, we can see we do have this alien object here
	we are returning the result page and we do have the course model attribute which returns Java. So it should work.
	Sometimes what happens is in your JSP because of some support JSTL might not work. So if we go back to alienresult page
	we have to add one more attribute here, which is isELIgnored="false".
